# personal-portfolio
This is my personal portfolio, where I showcase my projects, and where you can learn more about me! You can also reach me on this page through the 'contact' information.

In this repository, I will track my progress in building this portfolio, and include all details, concerns and tips that I think may be valuable/important in the future.

Day 1: Entire landing page completed (Not entirely responsive yet)

Notes/to-do's:
- Complete finishing touches/adjustments to padding and margins of items
- Create responsive CSS (complete media query versions)
-----------------------------

Day 2: Fully responsive Landing/About-me page completed.

to-do's:
- Design new 'skills' page (current one isn't great)
- Re-consider large background text idea for each page (perhaps completely remove it?)

Day 3: Created brand new design idea and implementation for about-me page! Really proud of this one, as it condenses the size of the page by alot, by placing all content about myself into one viewport height screen.

to-do's:
- Finish up about-me section (In particular the responsiveness on 'education' page, and begin/design the 'skills' page)
- Create the base layout of the boxes for the 'projects' section


Day 4: Create the base idea of the 'projects' page. This includes hover over divs, which darkens the background of the div, as well as revealing text to provide information about the project.

to-do's:
- Finish the nav bar on each project item ('source code', as well as 'view website')
- Make projects page responsive (mobile mode makes all project items stacked in one column)
