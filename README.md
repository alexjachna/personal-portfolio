# personal-portfolio
This is my personal portfolio, where I showcase my projects, and where you can learn more about me! You can also reach me on this page through the 'contact' information.

In this repository, I will track my progress in building this portfolio, and include all details, concerns and tips that I think may be valuable/important in the future.

Day 1: Entire landing page completed (Not entirely responsive yet)

Notes/to-do's:
- Complete finishing touches/adjustments to padding and margins of items
- Create responsive CSS (complete media query versions)
-----------------------------

Day 2: Fully responsive Landing/About-me page completed.

to-do's:
- Design new 'skills' page (current one isn't great)
- Re-consider large background text idea for each page (perhaps completely remove it?)
