# personal-portfolio
This is my personal portfolio, where I showcase my projects, and where you can learn more about me! You can also reach me on this page through the 'contact' information.

In this repository, I will track my progress in building this portfolio, and include all details, concerns and tips that I think may be valuable/important in the future.
